Nasa-Space Apps Challenge DSCOVR - 2023
## Background
Geomagnetic storms pose significant risks to modern technologies, especially GPS satellite systems and electrical power grids. These storms result from solar winds reaching Earth, causing deformation of the magnetic field and particle showers at the magnetic poles. Despite efforts, predicting these storms remains challenging due to uncertain travel times of solar material, ranging from two to four days or potentially missing Earth entirely.

DSCOVR, stationed at Lagrange point 1 a million miles from Earth, monitors plasma from a unique vantage point. It measures potential geomagnetic storm activity hours before reaching Earth, offering an early warning system.

NOAA employs solar wind measurements (density, temperature, speed, and magnetic field) to run simulations of Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere. Using these simulations, NOAA predicts the occurrence and intensity of geomagnetic storms, measured on the Planetary K-index (Kp) scale.

Originally planned for five years, DSCOVR is now in its eighth year. While the instrument measuring solar wind's magnetic field remains robust, the sensor for density, temperature, and speed is less sensitive, experiencing unpredictable faults. Real-time detection of these faults is challenging, especially during storm events. Compounded by the Sun's nearing peak activity, storms are more frequent than ever in DSCOVR's extended mission.

## Objective
Using the raw data from DSCOVR—faults and all—to predict geomagnetic storms on Earth.Currently the detection is done by relying on the well-calibrated level 2 data
